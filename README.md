# 🚀 DSA & Competitive Programming Journey

## 📌 Repository Title

**DSA-Competitive-Programming**

## 📖 Description

🚀 A structured repository focused on mastering Data Structures &
Algorithms for placements, competitive programming, and coding
interviews.

This repo documents my journey of solving problems consistently,
participating in contests, and strengthening core algorithmic thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is dedicated to:

-   Strengthening DSA fundamentals (Basics → Advanced)
-   Solving high-quality problems consistently
-   Preparing for product-based companies
-   Participating in bootcamp contests
-   Actively giving LeetCode Weekly & Biweekly contests
-   Becoming a strong competitive coder
-   Helping others follow structured sheets and improve

I already know the fundamentals well, but this repo focuses on solving
more problems, improving speed, pattern recognition, and building strong
algorithmic intuition.
